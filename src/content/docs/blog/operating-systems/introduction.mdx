# Introduction to Operating Systems

Operating systems are the fundamental software that manages computer hardware and provides services for computer programs. Understanding operating systems is crucial for system programming, performance optimization, and system administration.

## What is an Operating System?

An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between users and computer hardware.

## Core Components

### 1. Kernel
- **Process management**: Creating, scheduling, and terminating processes
- **Memory management**: Virtual memory, paging, and allocation
- **Device drivers**: Hardware abstraction and communication
- **System calls**: Interface between user programs and kernel

### 2. System Libraries
- **Standard libraries**: libc, system call wrappers
- **API layer**: Application programming interfaces
- **Utility functions**: Common programming utilities

### 3. System Utilities
- **File management**: ls, cp, mv commands
- **Process management**: ps, kill, top commands
- **System monitoring**: iostat, vmstat, netstat

## Process Management

### Process States
- **New**: Process being created
- **Running**: Instructions being executed
- **Waiting**: Waiting for an event
- **Ready**: Waiting to be assigned to a processor
- **Terminated**: Process has finished execution

### Scheduling Algorithms
- **FCFS (First Come, First Served)**: Simple queue-based scheduling
- **SJF (Shortest Job First)**: Optimal average waiting time
- **Round Robin**: Time-slice based scheduling
- **Priority Scheduling**: Priority-based execution order

### Linux Process Management
```bash
# View processes
ps aux
top
htop

# Process control
kill -9 PID
nice -n 10 command
renice -n 5 PID
```

## Memory Management

### Virtual Memory
- **Paging**: Memory division into fixed-size pages
- **Segmentation**: Memory division into logical segments
- **Page tables**: Mapping virtual to physical memory
- **TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer)**: Fast address translation

### Memory Allocation
- **Static allocation**: Fixed-size allocation
- **Dynamic allocation**: Runtime memory allocation
- **Memory fragmentation**: Internal and external fragmentation
- **Garbage collection**: Automatic memory reclamation

### Linux Memory Management
```bash
# Memory information
free -h
cat /proc/meminfo
vmstat

# Memory usage by process
ps aux --sort=-%mem
pmap PID
```

## File Systems

### File System Architecture
- **Virtual File System (VFS)**: Abstract file system layer
- **File system types**: ext4, XFS, Btrfs, NTFS
- **Inode management**: File metadata and structure
- **Journaling**: Data integrity and recovery

### File Operations
```bash
# File system operations
mount, umount
fsck, e2fsck
df -h
du -sh

# File permissions
chmod 755 file
chown user:group file
```

## Device Management

### Device Types
- **Character devices**: Sequential access (keyboard, serial)
- **Block devices**: Random access (disk drives)
- **Network devices**: Network interfaces
- **Virtual devices**: Software-defined devices

### Device Drivers
- **Kernel modules**: Loadable device drivers
- **Device files**: /dev directory structure
- **Device tree**: Hardware description framework

## System Calls

### Common System Calls
- **File operations**: open(), read(), write(), close()
- **Process operations**: fork(), exec(), wait(), exit()
- **Memory operations**: mmap(), brk(), sbrk()
- **Communication**: pipe(), socket(), bind(), connect()

### System Call Interface
```c
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/syscall.h>

// Direct system call
long result = syscall(SYS_write, fd, buffer, count);

// Library wrapper
ssize_t bytes_written = write(fd, buffer, count);
```

## Inter-Process Communication

### IPC Mechanisms
- **Pipes**: Unidirectional communication
- **Message queues**: Structured message exchange
- **Shared memory**: Fast memory sharing
- **Semaphores**: Synchronization primitives
- **Sockets**: Network-based communication

## Security and Permissions

### Linux Security Model
- **Users and groups**: User identification
- **File permissions**: Read, write, execute permissions
- **SetUID/SetGID**: Privileged execution
- **Capabilities**: Fine-grained permissions
- **SELinux/AppArmor**: Mandatory access control

## Performance Monitoring

### System Monitoring Tools
```bash
# CPU usage
top, htop
mpstat
sar

# Memory usage
free
vmstat
sar -r

# I/O statistics
iostat
iotop
sar -d
```
