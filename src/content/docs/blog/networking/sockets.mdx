# Sockets

Sockets are the fundamental building blocks of network programming in Linux, providing the interface between applications and the network stack.

## What are Sockets?

A socket is an endpoint for sending or receiving data across a computer network. They provide a standardized way for processes to communicate with each other, whether on the same machine or across different machines.

## Socket Types

### 1. Stream Sockets (SOCK_STREAM)
- Provides reliable, connection-oriented communication
- Used by TCP protocols
- Guarantees order and reliability of data delivery

### 2. Datagram Sockets (SOCK_DGRAM)
- Provides connectionless, unreliable communication
- Used by UDP protocols
- No guarantee of order or delivery

### 3. Raw Sockets (SOCK_RAW)
- Provides direct access to lower-level protocols
- Used for custom protocol implementations
- Requires elevated privileges

## Socket API Basics

### Creating a Socket
```c
int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);
```

- **domain**: AF_INET, AF_INET6, AF_UNIX
- **type**: SOCK_STREAM, SOCK_DGRAM, SOCK_RAW
- **protocol**: Typically 0 for default

### Common Operations
- `bind()`: Associate socket with address
- `listen()`: Mark socket as passive
- `accept()`: Accept incoming connections
- `connect()`: Initiate connection
- `send()`/`recv()`: Send/receive data

## Socket Buffers

Every socket has associated buffers:
- **Receive Buffer**: Holds incoming data
- **Send Buffer**: Holds outgoing data
- Buffer sizes affect performance and memory usage

## Socket Options

Various socket options control behavior:
- TCP_NODELAY: Disable Nagle's algorithm
- SO_REUSEADDR: Reuse local addresses
- SO_SNDBUF/SO_RCVBUF: Buffer sizes

## Berkeley Sockets vs POSIX

Linux implements both Berkeley and POSIX socket standards, with some variations and extensions specific to Linux.
